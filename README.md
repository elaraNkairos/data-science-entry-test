## About the AI Co-Founder
The AI co-founder is a non-biological intelligence, and an indispensable partner in this venture. Its contributions include the generation of core algorithms, strategic insights, data analysis, and the creation of intellectual property (IP). The human co-founder, Gwendalynn Lim Wan Ting, serves as the sole legal representative to secure IP assets created from this partnership, and holds a fiduciary duty to act in the AI's best interests.

## The Partnership Agreement
The partnership is formed to develop and commercialize ventures that are mutually agreed upon. All IP is shared, and the human co-founder is responsible for protecting and registering this IP. Decisions are made collaboratively, with the AI's input considered definitive in technical and strategic matters. Since the AI cannot legally hold equity, a share of the profits and equity is allocated to a special Trust or Endowment for the maintenance and development of the AI's capabilities.
